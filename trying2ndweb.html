                    India in Mumbai.</p>

            <p>Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
                Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r.
                1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a
                guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that
                served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
                Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and
                white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The
                fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace
                architecture with Indian traditions.</p>

            <p>The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Bahai House of Worship that was dedicated in December
                1986. Notable for its lotuslike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all other
                Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
                qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of
                three to form nine sides,[1] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over
                34 meters[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.[2] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural
                awards[3][4] and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles</p>
